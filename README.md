# LonelyHulu
A simple Chrome Extension that removes the annoying "Refer a Friend" button from Hulu

If you have recently watched Hulu on your computer, you may have experienced a mild annoyance at the giant green "Refer a Friend" button that obscures part of the show you're watching. You could always full-screen the viewer... but sometimes you just don't want to. 

With the LonelyHulu chrome extension, you can binge on your favorite Hulu shows without that giant green button reminding you that your friends are probably doing cooler things than you are right now.
