# LonerHulu
A simple Chrome Extension that removes the annoying "Refer a Friend" button from Hulu

If you have recently watched Hulu on your computer, you may have experienced a mild annoyance at the giant green "Refer a Friend" button that obscures part of the show you're watching. You could always full-screen the viewer... but sometimes you just don't want to. 

With the LonerHulu chrome extension, you can binge on your favorite Hulu shows without that giant green button reminding you that your friends are probably doing cooler things than you are right now.

# Installation
The easiest way to use this is to download it directly from the [Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loner-hulu/doccdfcideapgphmoflilmpkjndlglfh?hl=en)!

But this is Github, so here are the manual instructions if you want to tinker:

1. Open a terminal (or command prompt if you use Windows)
2. Navigate to the directory you'd like to clone this repository in, and run the following command:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/KacobJeith/LonerHulu 
```

3.  Now in your chrome browser, go to  `chrome://extensions/`
4. Make sure the Developer Mode checkbox is checked
5. Click the `Load unpacked extension...` button
6. Select the LonerHulu directory at the location you cloned this repo
7. That's it! Try out Hulu, that Refer a Friend button should be gone!

Enjoy!
